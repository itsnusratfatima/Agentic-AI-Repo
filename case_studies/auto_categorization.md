## Case Study: Auto-Categorization Agent

### Problem
Accountants spent ~4 hours/day categorizing transactions.
This created:
- bottlenecks
- inconsistent accuracy
- customer frustration

### Goal
Automate categorization to:
- reduce manual work
- increase accuracy
- eliminate backlog

### Solution
Built an agent that:
1. reads transaction metadata
2. uses classification models + rules
3. self-improves from corrections

### Techniques

- Prompt chaining
- Feedback loops
- Active learning

### Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Manual effort | 240 mins | 60 mins |
| Adoption | baseline | +24% |
| Accuracy (Month 1) | — | >80% |

### Why it worked
- Built with real accountant workflows
- Delivered fast value
- Iterated every release

### My Role
